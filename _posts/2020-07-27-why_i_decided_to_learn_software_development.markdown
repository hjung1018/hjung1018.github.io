I've always been interested in software development.  Right now I'm an MBA student on a break until the end of the cohort due to the pandemic, but I knew  I was always interested in software engineering.  I just never had the chance to pursue it.  I come from an HR background where I do heavily administrative, repetive tasks and it just got to the point where the work I was doing was mindless and I don't even get an input to mangaement about what we can do, even though I know it's better.  

With this knowledge, I do want to eventually pursue product mangement.
